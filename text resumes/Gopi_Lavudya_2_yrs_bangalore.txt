Currently, any existing PF customer who applies for a Residential Finance from ST Bank, his eligible loan amount is calculated based on the available room in the global DBR, however, it does not consider the factor that PF will mature after the 60th month of its maximum tenor and the system calculates the maximum eligible amount based on the differential DBR room only, which becomes quite insufficient for the customers to buy any property. Similarly, if an existing PF customer wants to apply for an additional loan without settling the existing one, then it also has to face the same issue.

Client : AT&T

Description: The Global Provisioning System (GPS) is a client-server application that is part of AT&T’s Integrated Global Enterprise Management System (iGEMS). GPS is an Inventory, Provisioning, and Procurement (IP&P) system.
It provides a Windows – based graphical user interface (GUI) that allows requests for products and services to be ordered (procured) and then provided (provisioned) to the customer once the order is completed. The system is automated and disseminates these various requests to their designated locations and tracks them to completion. Also important to GPS functionality are a number of other tools that interface directly with GPS. Tools such as the Client Request (CR) System and billing systems such as the Global Billing Platform (GBP) work together to provide customers with the ability to carry out a variety of tasks, tasks that are accomplished using a span of tools.

3rd Party Transport (3PT) Services
Description: There is a need to be able to develop an End-to-End (E2E) solution for 3rd Party Transport (3PT) Services for Domestic (DoM) and Most of World (MoW) where AT&T is CoR (Customer of Record) or has LoA (Letter of Agency) on behalf of customer. The solution must support transformation, migration and novation of 3rd Party services to AT&T services. The intent of this project is to address the needs of existing and new large complex outsourcing deals.  However, the tools and processes will also need to support 3rd Party Transport Service requirements that are not classified as "Outsourcing Megadeals" but satisfied the 3PT qualification screening process.

MRS support for (IPv6)
Description: The current AT&T MRS Product requires feature enhancements to include IPv4/v6 dual stack offering and IPv6-only offering.  MRS is a Business product available today, which includes many features to support a multitude of customer applications across all business segments.

The transition of the Internet to IPv6 is the only practical and readily available long-term solution to IPv4 address exhaustion. If nothing is done and based on a current run-rate, it is envisioned that AT&T will run out of unallocated IPv4 IP addresses by September 2011.  This project addresses the need to enable MRS support for (IPv6) in a dual-stack IPv4/IPv6.
