PROJECT DESCRIPTION


The Application mainly thrives on three processes:
Asynchronous Batch –Estimated time of Completion:24 hrs.(Driven by Shell Scripts)
Asynchronous Online- Estimated time of Completion:30 mins (Driven by Java Message Driven Beans).
Asynchronous JIT(Just In Time) - Estimated time of Completion: Current Instance (Driven by Java Message Driven Beans).
Synchronous UI. 

The project is aimed to electronically manage all the communications (Letter/Email), through a JAVA centred
System. There are a number of Template XMLs for various categories of Communications (Around 8k and being added continuously).

Whenever a communication is requested, an INPUT XML, having values for variable fields is fed in through message Queues/front end, whose content is parsed, analysed and validated through the enterprise application(JAVA based) against various complex business requirements .These processed values are now mapped with the Template XML and a TRANSACTION XML is generated.


Various External Systems like ECM-AT, Fraud, TRIUMPH, etc.  feed in additional data, whenever requested by the application, to be appended to the Transaction XML .
The external system interactions are either MQ Based or WEBSERVICE based.

The final transaction XML is then assembled through an assembly (THUNDERHEAD) tool, which produces two kinds of output:
 1>afp-for letter communication.
 2>html-for email communication.
These outputs are finally despatched either as Letter or Email, as required. The assembly call is web service Based.

Out of the 8k odd Templates, this project handles some 700 templates, Categorised mainly as ‘Dispute’ and by far the most complex in terms of business requirements.
