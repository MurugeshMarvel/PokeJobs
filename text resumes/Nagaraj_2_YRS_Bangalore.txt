iMFAST: Integra's Mobile Financial Applications Secure Terminal (iMFAST) is a platform designed to handle financial applications specifically targeted at rural customers.
         It offers all the advantages of the current day mobile banking environment, in a secure manner. The Terminal is highly secure as it uses RFID technology for identification and Biometrics for authentication. The device also requires online secure confirmation for the transactions made and thus facilitates absolutely safe transactions at the cost of a mobile phone call. The device uses normal phone connectivity for transactions and in areas where there is no phone connectivity available, it can record all the transactions offline and transfer them onto the server later, which makes it more flexible to use in the remote rural areas of the country. The Terminal gives a voice guidance support in the local language for the customers to self-operate the Terminal with minimal help.
