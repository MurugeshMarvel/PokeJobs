ACADEMIC PROJECT PROFILE

Title		  : Time based Event management with SNTP client and server.
Technologies 	  : C, Network Programming.                                                                      Environment    : Windows XP, Linux (Ubuntu).
Duration	  : 6 months.

Description: 
Project proposes a method of implementing standard time based client and server using Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) application with in an embedded home Audio/video (A/V) device.
First the SNTP client in the AV sub system requests for a precise time and obtains time information from the SNTP Server, SNTP server will in turn get the standard time (UTC) from remote NTP(Network time protocol)server through internet. So SNTP server will give this standard time to SNTP client. Next SNTP client will set the Real Time Clock (RTC) inside the AV system is adjusted with the SNTP server time with a call back mechanism. Multiple events (playing audio file, playing video file) inside the AV sub system will be performed at user configured time making the embedded RTC time as a reference.

Responsibilities: 
Developed Event management module.
Porting Mplayer to ARM Target board.
Cross compiling Linux kernel-2.6 to ARM Target board.
Implemented SNTP client and server in C language. 
Cross compiled SNTP client to ARM processor.
